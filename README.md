# Harnessing-Vector-Space-Models-for-Enhanced-Machine-Translations-and-Document-Search
This project focuses on integrating Vector Space Models (VSM) with Machine Translation (MT) models for enhancing document search and translation quality. It involves the use of  MarianMT for translation, GloVe for word embeddings, and cosine similarity for document ranking.
